{# This is a jinja2 comment, which flask has kindly implemented, you should read more and learn #}
{# about this different jinja codes as they are quite handy. You can do useful things with these, #} 
{# including inserting variables (see stylesheet href as example), if-else structures and for loops. #}

{# For testing purposes, I have layout.html, which is to be used as base for all webpages #}
{# So we need to extend this file to use layout.html #}

{% extends "layout.html" %}

{# In layout.html, there is a reserved block for header info, in which we can insert code from #}
{# index.html  So here, we insert stylesheet to page header, in case we want to use different #}
{# css for other webpages. #}

{% block header %}
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{{ url_for('static',filename='styles/default.css') }}"
{% endblock %}

{# Similarly in layout.html, there is block page body, in which we insert actual content of this page. #}

{% block body %}
    <div class="div_title">
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="div_text">
        <h2>This is h2 title</h2>
        <p>Here is some text</p>
    </div>
{% endblock %}
